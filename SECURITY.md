## ⚠️ Known Issues (Low Priority)

### Dependencies
- ⚠️ esbuild vulnerability (dev dependency only, affects development server)
- ⚠️ vitest dependencies with esbuild vulnerability (testing only)

### Recommendations for Production
1. Use a reverse proxy (nginx/cloudflare) with additional security headers
2. Implement rate limiting for the contact form endpoint
3. Consider adding a CAPTCHA to prevent spam
4. Regular dependency audits with `npm audit`
5. Use a vulnerability scanner like Snyk or OWASP ZAP

## Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env.local` file with:
```
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id  
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
```

**Important**: Never commit the `.env.local` file to version control!
